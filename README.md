# DotSlash - O Bug Kal Aana
Hack developed during DotSlash 2019
## Ideas
Our team worked on three different ideas related to the smart city track and solve it using the software based approaches  

- **Park Smart**   
    This hack focused on a software dominant approach to solve the problem of parking at public places such as fairs. We developed an approach based on QR codes to reduce the human interaction.  

- **Pothole Detection**  

  This approach is based on using the acceler-O-meter of android devices to detect potholes on the roads. The location of the potholes is stored on the server and displayed on the map to the designated office's dashboard.
- **Garb - O - meter**  
  This hack was based on the usage of Vision API to find the contemt of image and decide whether there's garbage or not in the uploaded image after which the location is shown on the map if it legit image having major content as garbage.
